    <h1>Fetch API</h1>

    <p>
        The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching (sending/receiving) resources.
        <br><br>
        It uses Request and Response objects.
        <br><br>
        The fetch() method is used to fetch a resource (data).
        <br><br>
        let promise = fetch(url, [options])
        <br><br>

        In Older days when we send api request then we get response in form of xml files.
        And These days when we send api request we get response in json format.
        JSON is Javascript Object Notation.
        JSON Format is look like javascript object but it is not javascript object.

        <br><br>
        Understanding Terms : 

        <br><br>
        AJAX is Asynchronous JS And XML
        <br><br>
        JSON is Javascript Object Notation => JSON alternate name AJAJ => Asynchronous JS And JSON
        <br><br>
        json() method : returns a second promise that resolves with the result of parsing the response body text as JSON 
        (Input is JSON, output is JS object)
