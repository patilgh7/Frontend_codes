<!-- 

Note : 

1. display: inline;
Behavior:
The element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

Height/Width:
You cannot set width and heightâ€”they are ignored.

Example elements:
<span>, <a>, <strong>

Use case:
Useful for styling small parts of text (e.g., highlight a word).


2. display: block;  This is by default property
Behavior:
The element starts on a new line and stretches the full width of its parent container.

Height/Width:
You can set width and height.

Example elements:
<div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>

Use case:
Used for large layout containers or sections.


3. display: inline-block;
Behavior:
The element behaves like inline (i.e., stays inline with other elements) but you can set width and height.

Combines:
Best of both inline and block.

Use case:
Useful for buttons, badges, or cards that sit next to each other but still need box styling.
