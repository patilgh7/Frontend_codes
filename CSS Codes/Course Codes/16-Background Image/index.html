<!-- 
Note :

In background image property : myntra.png file size is 300 * 168 px
And you are setting that image into height * width = 50 * 50 px so how can it will set.

For that we use :
background-size: contain; 
But Still it is divided into two image because we have 50*50 heigth width and myntra.png is 300 * 168 px so 
Thats why it is showing two images. 

For Showing only one image we use :
background-repeat: no-repeat; 



 background-size: cover; This property cover whole div...this will stretch the image to div size if div size greater than img size

 whereas  background-size: contain; gives whole image in that div

 you can check what happens by cover property by uncommenting  background-size: cover;


background-position: center; This property gives div center
