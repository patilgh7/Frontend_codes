Problem Statement :::   


When I am trying media query code i face below problem 

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

i have removed the line from code initially beacuse i dont know what it does the line and 

i have used below code of media query without this <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">


   @media screen and (width: 300px){
        .box {
            background-color: brown;
        }
      }

And I have tried with toggle device toolbar is off and stretching screen to 300px then its background perfectly changes to brown.

But when I have tried with toggle device toolbar ON and setting width value to responsive as 300 then this problem occur. when i hit command in console 

window.innerWidth  => it showing 980   

but i want that command should show 300 then I got this problem And I got answer please check below.

Answer : 



if you remove this line from code it does not give responsive width properly.


What This Meta Tag Does
This line tells the browser:

“Use the device’s actual screen width in CSS pixels, and don’t zoom in or scale the page.”



🔍 Breakdown of the Tag:
html

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

Attribute			Meaning
width=device-width	Set the page’s layout width equal to the device’s screen width (in CSS pixels)
initial-scale=1.0	Do not zoom — start at 100% scale

❌ What Happens Without This Tag?
If you don’t include this meta tag:

On phones or simulated mobile viewports, the browser pretends the screen is ~980px wide

It zooms out so the whole layout fits

Your media queries like max-width: 300px won’t work, because the browser thinks the screen is much wider

That’s why:

Even when Chrome’s device toolbar said “300px”, your @media never activated

Because without the meta tag, the browser still used a default layout width of ~980px

✅ What Happens With the Meta Tag?
As soon as you add:

html

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

Now:

The browser says: “Okay, I’ll treat the layout as exactly the width of the device or screen”

Your CSS media queries like @media (max-width: 300px) now trigger correctly

The scaling matches real screen behavior

📱 Real-Life Example
Scenario	window.innerWidth	Media Queries Work?
❌ Without Meta Tag	~980px	❌ No
✅ With Meta Tag	Matches actual width (e.g., 300px)	✅ Yes
